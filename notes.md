EVERYTHING IN RUBY IS AN OJECT

*Book* object  
attributes  
- cover: black
- texture: shiny
- pages: 1000
- print: small
- category: fiction
methods  
- turn the page
- close the book
- go to end
- find a page
- list chapters  

______________________
## Section 1
### part 6
wrote a basic "Hello World" file using the `puts` command
also installed Code Runner extension and ran code using `ctrl+shift+N`

### part 7
use terminal to run a file using `ruby <filename>`
also use `irb` to enter a ruby environment in your terminal (interactive ruby).
use `exit` or `quit` to close 

### part 12
*Interactive Ruby (IRB)*  
Ruby was one of the first programming langs to have a REPL (read, evaluate, print, loop) environment.  
When using `puts` the actual return from IRB will be => nil b/c puts just prints to the screen and doesn't actually change the program.  

______________________
## Section 2  

### part 13 (puts)
- Can use semicolons but Ruby automatically adds a newline at the end of every line so most don't use.
`the_puts_method.rb`  

### part 14 (print)
`the_print_method.rb`  

### part 15 (p)
`the_p_method.rb`  

### part 16 (basic arithmetic in ruby)
`basic_arithmetic.rb`
- followed by a quiz (100%)  


### part 17 (comments)
`comments.rb`  
- use # at beginning of a line or...
- use `=begin` and `=end` at to make a multi line comment.  

### part 18 (variables)
`variables.rb`
- A variable is a refernce to an objecct. That object is subject ot change.
- Variables are sometimes called pointers or identifiers.
- the variable itself is NOT an object. It is a placeholder for an object.
- Ruby is *dynamically typed*. Variable types do not have to be declared. The same variable can be reassigned to an object of another data type.  

Variable Syntax  
Examples...
- `name = "Caleb"`
- `last_name = "Sanderson"`
- `handsome = true`
- `age = 24 + 1`  

more on syntax...
- vars are pointed to an objeect with the equal sign.
- the right side of the equal sign is *always* evaluated first.
- var names should start with a lowercase letter or underscore.
- spaces are not allowed. Use underscores instead (`lower_snake_case`).
- var names are *case sensitive*. Don't reuse and stick to lower snake case.
- Don't use any of Ruby's reserved keywords (i.e. puts or print)  

### part 19 (parallel var assignment and swapping var values)  
`parallel_variable_assignments.rb`

### part 20 (constants)
`constants.rb`

### part 21 (intro to object methods)
`intro_to_object_methods.rb`

Methods that are available on an object depend on it's type.

### part 22 (return values and the nil object)
using IRB
- give it an integer and it gives it right back
- give it a string and it gives it right back
- give it an operation and it returns the result  

When you give Ruby something it has to return and object but if you give it something like `puts` that doens't actually return and object (it simply prints something to the screen) it will return `nil`. Nil is the absence of something.

### part 23 (string interpolation)
`string_interpolation.rb`

### part 24 (the gets method and the chomp method)
Begin in IRB

- `gets` and hit return
  - Ruby waits for input and after giving it something it will return.
  - `gets` automatically adds the `\n` new line character at the end of the returned object
- `gets.chomp` calls the `chomp` method on the result of the gets method. This is call _*"method chaining"*_

irb(main):001:0> gets
Caleb
=> "Caleb\n"
irb(main):002:0> name = gets.chomp
Caleb
=> "Caleb"
irb(main):003:0> name
=> "Caleb"
irb(main):004:0> puts "Thank you, #{name}. See you later!"
Thank you, Caleb. See you later!
=> nil
irb(main):005:0>
```

Go to terminal and run `ruby the_gets_method.rb` to run the simple program.

## Section 3 - Number and Booleans
### intro to numbers and the .class method  

[Integer Documentation](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.3/Integer.html)

EVERYTHING is an object. 
- Integers are objects that come from the integer class called `Fixednum`
- Floats have their own class called `Float`

`intro_to_numbers.rb`  

### intro to booleans
`intro_to_booleans.rb`  

### the .odd? and .even? predicate methods
`the_odd\?_and_even\?_methods.rb`  

### comparison with the Equality (==) operator
`comparison_with_the_equality_operator.rb`  

### Comparison with the Inequality (!=) Operator
`comparison_with_the_inequality_operator.rb`  

### Less than and Greater than Operators
`less_than_and_greater_than_operators.rb`

### Arithmetic Methods and Basic Arguments
